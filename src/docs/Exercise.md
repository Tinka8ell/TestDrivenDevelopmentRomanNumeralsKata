# 💻 Test-Driven Development - Roman Numerals Kata 💻

-----

## 🤔 What is a kata?

🥋A Kata in martial arts means “a system of individual training exercises”. 
Just like in martial arts, coding also requires consistent practise to hone in the skill. 
As you move through the interview stages of the programme, 
you will most likely be sent tech tasks and/or coding “Katas" 
to complete for your take-home/live interviews. 
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a sought after skill as an engineer in the tech industry, 
as it can help you write testable and clean code through a test-first approach. 
We call this ‘test-driving’ a program.

## What do I have to do?

💻 We would like you to plan out and spend 30-45 minutes having a go at the Roman Numerals Kata 
using Test-Driven Development. We don't expect you to have finished the solution for the seminar 
but that you have had a good go at using Test-Driven Development.

⚙️  Before you start on this Kata make sure...⚙️

✅  You watch the Test-Driven Development session if you didn't attend it

✅  You use the programming language recommended for your programme. If you are unsure, please reach out to one of the Tech Coaches.

✅  You have chosen a unit testing framework of your choice.

✅  You have a project ready to go in your chosen Code Editor or IDE set up with a failing unit test.

## 🗒️ Instructions

👉 Read the Roman Numerals Kata requirements. You can find it in the following 
link: https://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/ 
(there are many websites like Coding Dojo outlining the most popular Katas, one of them is the Roman Numerals Kata).

👉 Please note that the kata ‘clues’ section refers to some C# testing frameworks like XUnit, please ignore these.

👉 Solve the Roman Numerals kata in the programming language for the programme you are attending, 
if you are unsure, please reach out to a tech coach.

👉 Please set aside up to 10 minutes to make a start on this Kata, 
don’t worry if you don’t reach a full solution as this Kata is designed for you to practise 
test-driven development and understand the process. We don't expect you to have finished the 
solution for the seminar but that you have had a good go at using Test-Driven Development.

## 💡Tips & Tricks on how to get started

Set up your Code Editor / IDE beforehand so you’re ready to write the unit tests and code.

Before you write your code, make sure you understand the problem statement. 
The Kata may seem large at first, so break it down into smaller, manageable pieces.

Please note down your test cases, inputs and outputs on a notepad like 
Word / Notepad++ / piece of paper to validate your understanding.

Use the Triple A Structure - Arrange, Act, Assert to guide you when writing your unit tests

Use the RED - GREEN - REFACTOR cycle: Write one failing test first and write the simplest code 
to make that test pass, then see if there is any opportunity to refactor. 
If not, move onto writing your next test and follow the cycle through as you build up your solution.

Remember to consider a range of different test cases and edge cases.

## 💡Apply PseudoCode to help you think through your logic

Pseudocode is a description of the steps for an algorithm and can be used to help you think through your logic.

In this video at the 02:20 timestamp, you can see Pseudocode in action on a 
Codewars challenge: https://storage.googleapis.com/tech-returners-course/Pre-Journey/solving_problems_on_codewars.mp4

In the video, observe how Harriet reads through the solution out loud and notice how she 
pseudo codes what she needs to do before writing any code.

## 😺  Test-Driven Development Seminar Session

✅  During the seminar session which is happening on Tuesday 5th April, 
you will have the chance to take part in an open group discussion about applying 
the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to solving the Roman Numerals Kata. 
Feel free to bring any sketches or notes that you have made, or any parts of code that you wanted to share. 
Think of it like a live commentary of your reasoning on 'why' and 'how' you're going about solving the Kata. 
This is a common ask during tech interviews.

😊 Happy Coding!

## 🥋Extension Exercises

👉 As an optional challenge, you can try to do the Roman Numerals kata again in another programming language.

👉 If you finished the kata, why not have a go at another Kata?
